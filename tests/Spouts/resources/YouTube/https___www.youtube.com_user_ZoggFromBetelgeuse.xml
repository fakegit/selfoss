This is the second part of a three-part miniseries on the shape of the universe. Could the universe be curved? What is curvature, anyway? What is the cosmological principle? And is the universe maybe some sort of hyperbanana?

This is the first part of a three-part miniseries on the shape of the universe. Is the universe infinite? Does it have an edge? In this part, we will talk about the possibility of a flat, finite universe without edge.

   <media:description>What is vision?
How does the eye preprocess data?
What happens with the data in the brain?
How do earthlings create a model of the world in their head?
How do earthlings recognize shapes?
Do earthlings have a brain cell for Halle Berry?
Why is color a matter of biology, and not of physics?
What is color anyway?
What's so special about the vision of the mantis shrimp?
What is a levy drone?
And what has color to do with the worst brass bands in the Galaxy?

What is a ritual?
Why are rituals part of everyday's life?
What have sports events, funerals and political gatherings in common?
What is the purpose of rituals?
Why would society as we know it be impossible without rituals?
What are symbols?
And why do earthlings put symbols onto their t-shirt?

   <media:description>Every Youtuber needs an AdSense account to earn money, be a YouTube partner, or join a network. I had an AdSense account as well, and I took care of respecting the rules, not clicking on my own ads etc. 

But some weeks ago, AdSense closed my account for &quot;invalid action&quot; - whatever that means. They wrote of &quot;my violation&quot; but refused to specify what I'm actually accused of. They only linked to a generic list of violations, none of which applied to my case. However, they were very clear on the fact that I am banned for life and that I'm not allowed to open another account.

After two refused appeals, I made this video.

-------------------------------------------

As promised in the video, the full quotes on the decline of language:

&quot;In these days of just about enough perils facing our nation, there is plenty of evidence around to conclude that our grip on our glorious language may be loosening.&quot;
---Dick Cavett, &quot;It's Only Language.&quot; The New York Times, 2007

&quot;Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way.&quot;
---George Orwell, &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;, 1946


&quot;It is shameful to see our very colleges filled with students who seldom set down three consecutive sentences that do not reek with solecisms of expression, of syntax, and of style; while not a few, when they leave the college halls, the winners of a university degree, make blunders even of orthography that might well disgrace a swineherd.&quot;
--- Harry Thurston Peck, &quot;What Is Good English?&quot;, 1899

&quot;[English shows] how rapidly the language of a nation important both in history and literature can sink&quot;
---August Schleicher, 1848

&quot;...that many pronunciations, which thirty or forty years ago were confined to the vulgar, are gradually gaining ground [among people of fashion]; and if something is not done to stop this growing evil ...English is  likely to become a mere jargon&quot;
---Thomas Sheridan, 1780

&quot;...our Language is extremely imperfect; that its daily Improvements are by no means in proportion to its daily Corruptions; and the Pretenders to polish and refine it, have chiefly multiplied Abuses and Absurdities; and, that in many Instances, it offends against every Part of Grammar.&quot;
--- Jonathan Swift, 1712

&quot;And, in few words, I dare say; that of all the Studies of men, nothing may be sooner obtain'd, than this vicious abundance of Phrase, this trick of Metaphors, this volubility of Tongue, which makes so great a noise in the World. But I spend words in vain; for the evil is now so inveterate, that it is hard to know whom to blame, or where to begin to reform.&quot;
--- Thomas Sprat, The History of the Royal Society, 1667

&quot;Practically everyone...in those days spoke correctly, but the lapse of time has certainly had a deteriorating effect in this respect.&quot; 
---Cicero, 46 BC.</media:description>

   <media:description>Fourth episode of Earthlings 101, the crash course for alien visitors.

Where does the concept of good and evil come from? 
What does it mean?
Why can't humans just agree to cooperate?
Why is a human a murderer when he kills his neighbour, but a hero if he kills a thousand foreigners?
Why do earthlings think that people in enemy countries are evil?
And what has it all to do with Cthulhu and Xenu being thrown into prison? 

Aliens, when you see this video, your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as humans, knowing good and evil!
